Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.</td>\n",

              "1  This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.   \n",

The game mechanics are pretty decent, although, jumping can feel awkward at times (especially when you get the Wings). Where this game really excels, is in the overall story, dialogue, and music. I can't wait to see if any other games in the series come out (Darksiders II feels the same as this one, but I haven't played much of it...yet).</td>\n",

Ubersoldier II is like that. It is so bad, so utterly horrible, so poorly made that it should never be played... but for some reason I loved nearly every second of it.  This game is the 'Sharknado' of video games. It is bad in nearly every aspect but still a fun romp. The voice acting is so bad, the story is almost completely nonsensical, the cutscenes are laughably awful. This being said, everytime there is any kind of story exposition I can't help but crack a smile and just enjoy it. The gunplay itself is pretty bland, not horrible but nothing amazing. You get some special powers that spice things up a little and are really fun the first few times you use them but pretty quickly get stale. The level design is so so so so bad that sometimes when I was playing through the game I would get stuck running around in circles while trying to complete a level and would end up screaming WHY????? when I finally figure out how to progress. But even navigating these bizarre levels was kind of fun in their own way. It was like exploring some kind of weird post modern work of art.  Is this a good game? Hell no. Is this game worth playing? Hell yes. (maybe just get it when it's on sale)</td>\n",

The game mechanics are pretty decent, although, jumping can feel awkward at times (especially when you get the Wings). Where this game really excels, is in the overall story, dialogue, and music. I can't wait to see if any other games in the series come out (Darksiders II feels the same as this one, but I haven't played much of it...yet).   \n",

I was left crying at my desk by this soft, yet emotional experience. I want to see more 'games' like this.  This game is definitly for grown-ups, as it is mostly an emotional experience. I really respect those kind of games and I really want to see more of this kind of games.   \n",

Like something that is just objectively not well made but is still for some reason incredibly enjoyable? Ubersoldier II is like that. It is so bad, so utterly horrible, so poorly made that it should never be played... but for some reason I loved nearly every second of it.  This game is the 'Sharknado' of video games. It is bad in nearly every aspect but still a fun romp. The voice acting is so bad, the story is almost completely nonsensical, the cutscenes are laughably awful. This being said, everytime there is any kind of story exposition I can't help but crack a smile and just enjoy it. The gunplay itself is pretty bland, not horrible but nothing amazing. You get some special powers that spice things up a little and are really fun the first few times you use them but pretty quickly get stale. The level design is so so so so bad that sometimes when I was playing through the game I would get stuck running around in circles while trying to complete a level and would end up screaming WHY????? when I finally figure out how to progress. But even navigating these bizarre levels was kind of fun in their own way. It was like exploring some kind of weird post modern work of art.  Is this a good game? Hell no. Is this game worth playing?

              "2833495  A little game with big ambitions that (somewhat rightfully) became something of a sensation. It's good but not THAT great.  GOOD + core gameplay is simple enough that you can pick it up right away, but also has suficient depth to it for you to keep playing and perfecting your skills + excellent production values - music, aesthetics, sound effects, physics, handling, presentation - everything is polished, everything works the way it's supposed to + large, active community - you won't have any trouble finding games or opponents + customization - other than some small differences in hitboxes, the cars are all the same but they can be customized to fit your taste - other than colors, you also have different collectible tyres, hats, antennas and boost trails + constant updates and free content - and the devs don't seem to be stopping the support anytime soon + infinite replayability for a very decent price - you have achievements, you have collectibles, you have seasons and competitive leagues, but ultimately it's a game of virtual football you get to play with RC cars and you can play that until the end of time  BAD - 12 year olds, 12 year olds everywhere... - also rage quitters that leave a 5 min game mid way after trailing behind two goals, or obnoxious teammates that aggravate you if you don't play perfectly - might just not be your thing - first of all it's competitive, second the controls aren't as intuitive as you'd think and third there's an eventual skill threshold in the game (in which you're supposed to learn to do aerials) that some players might find too steep  I've annoyed my fair share of pubescent boys with my inferior hand-eye coordination and lackluster aerial skills, but I've mostly had fun doing it.

              "      <td>This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.</td>\n",

              "0  This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.   \n",

The positives: + More collectibles + Challenges + More costumes + Huge world to explore with multiple biomes, new plants, and animals + Mobility options are built into BUD instead of being plant based (i.e. Glider and Air Break instead of Flower and Leaf) + Additional character in POD, who can help you find things on the map  The negative: - BUD can be difficult to handle in challenges as you have to be more precise with his movements during a limited amount of time  Other than the one negative, Ubisoft Reflections has made a perfect sequel to the first game and they should be very proud of their work!</td>\n",

The positives: + More collectibles + Challenges + More costumes + Huge world to explore with multiple biomes, new plants, and animals + Mobility options are built into BUD instead of being plant based (i.e. Glider and Air Break instead of Flower and Leaf) + Additional character in POD, who can help you find things on the map  The negative: - BUD can be difficult to handle in challenges as you have to be more precise with his movements during a limited amount of time  Other than the one negative, Ubisoft Reflections has made a perfect sequel to the first game and they should be very proud of their work!   \n",

The positives: + More collectibles + Challenges + More costumes + Huge world to explore with multiple biomes, new plants, and animals + Mobility options are built into BUD instead of being plant based (i.e. Glider and Air Break instead of Flower and Leaf) + Additional character in POD, who can help you find things on the map  The negative: - BUD can be difficult to handle in challenges as you have to be more precise with his movements during a limited amount of time  Other than the one negative, Ubisoft Reflections has made a perfect sequel to the first game and they should be very proud of their work!</td>\n",

The positives: + More collectibles + Challenges + More costumes + Huge world to explore with multiple biomes, new plants, and animals + Mobility options are built into BUD instead of being plant based (i.e. Glider and Air Break instead of Flower and Leaf) + Additional character in POD, who can help you find things on the map  The negative: - BUD can be difficult to handle in challenges as you have to be more precise with his movements during a limited amount of time  Other than the one negative, Ubisoft Reflections has made a perfect sequel to the first game and they should be very proud of their work!   \n",
